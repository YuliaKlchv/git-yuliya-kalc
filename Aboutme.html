	<p><strong>I would like to welcome you my short biograpy</strong></p>
	<hr>

	<p>My name is Yuliya. I am originally from Bulgaria. My family moved to Turkey with so many relatives of ours when i was 
	3 months old. The main reason was the politics. Thats a huge subject and not so much fun and i skip it with pleasure.I lived in Istanbul until i finished my highschool and i moved to Izmir- which is one of my favourite cities in the world- to study Maths. After 3 years of my study i went to USA for Work&Travel.It was so adventureous for me and i would say that it was one of the biggest experience of my life.When i was back to Izmir, i faced with some unfair situations in the university and i quit.Upss!Here is the breaking point of my life.</p>
  <p>I came to Vienna 9 years ago. I started from 0 to learn German at the course. After 6 months of arriving the city, i finished the course and my nightmare started. I went to Technical University of Vienna to study Technical Mathematics. For 3 years i struggled a lot to understand which kinf of mathematics it was(cos the curriculum was so different than used to study) and also my german was absolutely not enough to pass exams.At the same time i had some family issues which made me to go to Istanbul often and stay longer there, unfortunately all those things didn't help me to adapt the country but taught me something else.  So i quit for the second time studying mathematics. Absolutely first time should have been enough to understand but...It is so hard for me to give up on the things i like and i forced it till the end.</p>
  <p>I worked in many different places during the time i had breaks from studying, mostly in the supermarkts(i litereally tried most of them),bakeries, restaurants, but none of them is a place for me to work for ever.
	And i am here to become a developer which i am dreaming over a year. I have finished one short-term programming course to have a start and now i want to improve myself, <i>learn</i> and <i>learn</i> more and work in this area and <i>learn</i> forever.</p>
